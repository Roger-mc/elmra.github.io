      <h3>What Does It Mean to Be Still?</h3>
      <p>Stillness is not the absence of motion, but the presence of clarity. In a world of noise, speed, and reaction, Elmra begins in the sacred pause. To be still is to step outside the whirlpool of distraction and return to what is real, true, and foundational.</p>

      <p>Stillness allows you to listen—to your own conscience, to nature, and to the deeper current of life. From this place of presence, truth becomes possible.</p>
