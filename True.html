      <h3>What Does It Mean to Be True?</h3>
      <p>Truth in Elmra is not dogma or perfection. It is the daily discipline of aligning your words, actions, and values. Truth requires courage—the courage to confront your flaws, speak with integrity, and live in a way that honors what matters most.</p>

      <p>Being true means not hiding from reality, but also not being cruel with it. It is justice without righteousness. Honesty without arrogance. Conviction with compassion.</p>
