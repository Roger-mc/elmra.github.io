      <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
      <p>
        Elmra guides a quiet revolution inward, helping people reclaim their attention from systems designed to fragment it.  
        In a world trained to keep us scrolling and separate, we pause, connect, and remember what matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, technology is not a tool to be wielded, but a companion on the path.  
        With care and intention, it becomes an extension of what’s highest in us, our focus, our values, our shared humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe in designing alongside technology, not in opposition to it.  
        Not to be consumed, but to be accompanied, augmented by systems that help us grow stronger, more present, and more connected than we could alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not about escape. It’s about remembering. About coming home, together.
