      <h3>What Does It Mean to Rise?</h3>
      <p>Rising is not just survival it's ascension. It means standing up when the world expects you to fold. It’s showing up for others while still doing the work within. In Elmra, rising is the ethical act of advancing: toward truth, toward meaning, toward the service of something bigger than self.</p>

      <p>Rising is choosing impact over inertia. Service over silence. It’s what comes after stillness, and what carries truth into the world.</p>
