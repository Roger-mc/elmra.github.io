      <h3>What it means to walk</h3>
      <p>The shared path is a quiet decision: stand when folding is easy, reach outward while working inward. In Elmra this movement is ethical and collective toward meaning, toward service, toward something larger than self.</p>

      <p>It favours impact over drift, service over self Indulgence. Days start in stillness and focuses on progress at pace.</p>

      <h3>Forward together</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Take the step before you, over a life they are legion.</li>
        <li>Serve those near you, and the greater community to which you belong</li>
        <li>Build strength through rhythm, nourish the body, test the will, quiet the mind</li>
        <li>Where fear appears, witness it. Then act from reason, not reflex.</li>
        <li>A lone path can be fast, but the lasting one is walked in friendship.</li>
      </ul>
