      <h3>What it means to walk</h3>
      <p>The shared path is a quiet decision: stand when folding is easy, reach outward while working inward. In Elmra this movement is ethical and collective toward meaning, toward service, toward something larger than self.</p>

      <p>It favours impact over drift, service over silence. It starts in stillness and carries truth into the world.</p>

      <h3>Forward together</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One deliberate step each day, however small</li>
        <li>Serve your circle: family, community, planet</li>
        <li>Practise resilience: fuel, move, reflect and rest</li>
        <li>Notice fear, then choose</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To go fast, going alone is an option. To go far, together is a requirement</p>
