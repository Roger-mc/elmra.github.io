    <h3>What it means to walk together</h3>
    <p>Modern life has fragmented families and communities. The shared path is a quiet decision: to stand when folding is easy, to reach outward while working inward. In Elmra, this movement is ethical and collective—toward meaning, toward service, toward something larger than self.</p>

    <p>It favors community impact over drift, and service over self-indulgence. Days begin in stillness and focus on purposeful progress.</p>

      <h3>Now is the time to hold the line, to rebuild community and reclaim what it means to be human, together.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strength is found in numbers.</strong> Not in noise, but in aligned action.</li>
        <li>A lone path can be fast, but the lasting one is walked in friendship.</li>
        <li><strong>Wisdom lives in crowds.</strong> Not in chaos, but in collective knowing.</li>
        <li>Serve those near you, and the greater community to which you belong.</li>
        <li>Fear loses its grip when we walk with others.</li>
        <li><strong>A shared path is not a compromise. It’s a covenant.</strong></li>
