      <h3>What does it mean to be true to yourself?</h3>
      <p>
        To be true to yourself is not indulgence. It’s alignment. It is the quiet work of living in step with what you believe is right even when it’s hard. Even when no one sees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth is not a weapon, it’s a compass requiring courage, not perfection. It is the strength to say, “This matters,” and to shape your days around that. When we live this way, we don’t just speak truth we become it.
      </p>

      <h3>Practise truth</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Notice where your actions drift from your values. Begin there.</li>
        <li>Speak clearly, even when your voice is quiet.</li>
        <li>Take responsibility for what you believe. Let it guide you gently.</li>
        <li>Don’t perform. Connect. Let your presence be the proof.</li>
        <li>And when you forget begin again. That, too, is truth.</li>
      </ul>
