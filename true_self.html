      <h3>What does it mean to be true to yourself?</h3>
      <p>
        To be true to yourself is not indulgence, it’s alignment. It is the quiet work of living in step with what you believe is right, even when it’s hard and no one sees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perfection is an outdated illusion, let it go. Sanity begins when we accept life on its terms and focus our actions on what truly matters.
